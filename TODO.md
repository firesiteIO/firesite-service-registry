**Last Updated**: 2025-07-20 by Claude Code  
**Status**: ‚úÖ PUBLISHED & WORKING - v0.1.0 live on NPM with automated CI/CD

## üéâ Major Milestones Completed

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETE)
- [x] NPM package published and working: `@firesite/service-registry@0.1.0`
- [x] Dual environment support (Node.js file-based + Browser HTTP-based)
- [x] Comprehensive TypeScript implementation with full type definitions
- [x] 83 comprehensive tests covering all functionality
- [x] Proper package structure and build pipeline

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: CI/CD & Publishing (COMPLETE)
- [x] GitHub Actions workflow with pragmatic validation approach
- [x] Automated NPM publishing (triggers on version changes)
- [x] Multi-Node.js version testing (18, 20)
- [x] Security audit, TypeScript validation, ESLint, and build verification
- [x] Package successfully published and available on NPM registry

### ‚úÖ Phase 3: Integration (COMPLETE)
- [x] Migrated firesite-mcp project to use NPM package
- [x] Removed local service-registry.js files
- [x] Verified CLI functionality with NPM package
- [x] Production testing completed successfully

## üîß Current Cleanup Tasks

### ESLint Warning Cleanup (Low Priority)
*From CI/CD Pipeline Annotations - 10 warnings to resolve:*

- [ ] Remove unused `afterEach` import in `src/__tests__/browser-registry.test.ts:5`
- [ ] Remove unused `ServiceInfo` import in `src/__tests__/service-registry.test.ts:7`  
- [ ] Remove unused `ServiceRegistryType` import in `src/__tests__/types.test.ts:8`
- [ ] Remove unused `DiscoverOptions` import in `src/__tests__/types.test.ts:10`
- [ ] Remove unused `HealthCheckOptions` import in `src/__tests__/types.test.ts:11`

*Note: These are non-blocking ESLint warnings that don't affect functionality*

## üöÄ Future Enhancement Opportunities

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement service discovery caching with configurable TTL
- [ ] Add connection pooling for HTTP registry requests
- [ ] Optimize registry file I/O for high-frequency updates

### Advanced Features  
- [ ] Event-driven service status notifications
- [ ] Health check history and trend analysis
- [ ] Automatic service dependency mapping
- [ ] Circuit breaker pattern for unhealthy services

### Developer Experience
- [ ] CLI tools for registry inspection and debugging
- [ ] Visual dashboard for service registry monitoring
- [ ] Integration examples for popular frameworks
- [ ] Performance benchmarking utilities
