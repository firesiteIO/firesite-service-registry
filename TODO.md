- [ ] Document breaking changes and migration paths

#### Documentation & Examples
- [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Add integration examples for common frameworks
- [ ] Create migration guide from existing implementations
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide

## Quality Gates & Requirements

### Code Quality (MANDATORY)
- [ ] 95% test coverage across all metrics
- [ ] Zero ESLint errors
- [ ] Zero TypeScript errors
- [ ] All Prettier formatting applied
- [ ] All JSDoc documentation complete

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Service discovery < 100ms in Node.js
- [ ] Service discovery < 500ms in browser
- [ ] Registry file size < 1MB for 1000 services
- [ ] Memory usage < 50MB for Node.js implementation

### Compatibility Requirements
- [ ] Node.js 16+ support
- [ ] Modern browser support (ES2020+)
- [ ] TypeScript 4.5+ compatibility
- [ ] Both CommonJS and ESM module support

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risk Items
- **Breaking Changes**: Ensure backward compatibility during migration
  - Mitigation: Extensive testing with existing implementations
  - Mitigation: Phased rollout with fallback mechanisms

- **NPM Publishing**: First-time NPM package creation and management
  - Mitigation: Detailed documentation and step-by-step process
  - Mitigation: Test publishing to private registry first

- **Cross-Environment Compatibility**: Ensuring browser and Node.js work seamlessly
  - Mitigation: Comprehensive testing in both environments
  - Mitigation: Clear separation of environment-specific code

### Medium Risk Items
- **Performance Impact**: Introducing NPM dependency overhead
  - Mitigation: Lightweight implementation with minimal dependencies
  - Mitigation: Performance benchmarking against current implementations

- **Migration Complexity**: Updating multiple projects simultaneously
  - Mitigation: Project-by-project migration strategy
  - Mitigation: Maintaining compatibility layers during transition

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Complete When:
- âœ… Package can be imported in both Node.js and browser
- âœ… All core methods working (register, discover, health check)
- âœ… 95% test coverage achieved
- âœ… TypeScript definitions complete

### Phase 2 Complete When:
- âœ… Automated NPM publishing working
- âœ… CI/CD pipeline fully functional
- âœ… Package available on NPM registry

### Phase 3 Complete When:
- âœ… Enhanced features implemented and tested
- âœ… Performance requirements met
- âœ… Event system functional

### Phase 4 Complete When:
- âœ… All Firesite projects migrated
- âœ… Legacy implementations removed
- âœ… Documentation complete
- âœ… Zero breaking changes in ecosystem

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Package.json Setup** - Complete metadata and dependency configuration
2. **Directory Structure** - Create proper src/, dist/, tests/ organization
3. **TypeScript Configuration** - Set up compilation and type checking
4. **Core Implementation Start** - Begin with Node.js file-based implementation
5. **Testing Framework** - Set up Vitest with coverage reporting

## Dependencies & External Requirements

### NPM Organization Setup Required
- Create @firesite organization on NPM
- Configure organization access and permissions
- Set up billing if private packages needed

### GitHub Secrets Required
- NPM_TOKEN: For automated publishing
- GITHUB_TOKEN: For release automation

### Development Dependencies Needed
- TypeScript
- Vitest (testing framework)
- @types/node
- ESLint + Prettier
- Coverage reporting tools
